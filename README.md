# F1TenthTeam8FinalProject

In order to run our code, you must first download the file `nerf_imitation_model_lam_1.pth` from the Google Drive link we shared with the teaching team. Place this file in the directory `final_project/share`. You can then build the package as normal and run it. The `.pth` file could not be provided here due to its large size.
